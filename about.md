Hi there, I'm Matt. 

I'm currently a Machine Learning Scientist at [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/), where I work on Generative AI applications and the [Lens](https://www.tempus.com/life-sciences/lens/) platform for oncology data science. I'm interested in discovering hidden stories from data, and using them to solve human problems.

I completed my first master's degree in physics at the 
University of Manchester, where I researched [Bayesian inference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fV6HB7wGF7PJa3SLyz1GXGkPLRz3RPOJ/view?usp=sharing) and its application as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease. I spent my third year abroad at the 
[University of Toronto](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~nonlin/abstracts/MWest_479_report_2016_abstract.html). I then worked as a data scientist at [Arblet](http://www.arblet.com/) in Tokyo, before moving to do a masters in computational biology at Harvard, where I was a [Frank Knox Fellow](https://frankknox.harvard.edu/).

During this time I spent summers at [BioMarin](https://www.biomarin.com/) and [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/), before carrying on with my thesis research in digital phenotyping as a data scientst at [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/research/mind-data-science-lab), using electronic records to uncover heterogeneity in Alzheimer's and related dementias. 

If you'd like to discuss working on a project together, send me an [email](mailto:m.west2718@gmail.com),
or contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwestt/).
