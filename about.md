Hi there, I'm Matt. 

I'm currently a [Frank Knox Fellow](https://frankknox.harvard.edu/people/matthew-west) 
at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), 
where I study computational biology.

I'm interested in discovering hidden stories from data, and using them to solve 
human problems. I love travelling to unusual places, and I'm a huge geography nerd.

I completed my master's degree in physics with theoretical physics at the 
University of Manchester in 2017, where I researched [Bayesian inference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fV6HB7wGF7PJa3SLyz1GXGkPLRz3RPOJ/view?usp=sharing) and its
application as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease. I spent my third year abroad at the 
[University of Toronto](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~nonlin/abstracts/MWest_479_report_2016_abstract.html). 

Since then, I've worked as a data scientist at [Arblet](http://www.arblet.com/) in Tokyo, and more recently on freelance projects in a variety of 
locations. If you'd like to discuss working on a project together, send me an [email](mailto:m.west2718@gmail.com),
or contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwestt/).
